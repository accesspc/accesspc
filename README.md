### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m @accesspc
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps, Linux, AWS, Python and new technologies in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kubernetes in my own home lab
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require building new architectures or setting up continuous integration and delivery
- 📫 You can always reach me on my email, which is the same as github handle, @gamil.com
- 😄 Pronouns: the ones that I was born with
- ⚡ Fun fact: there are so many restaurants and pubs in London, that if you eat/drink every night out in a different one, it would take you over 40 years to visit them all.
